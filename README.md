With a great interest in Cyber Security, Iâ€™m in my first year as a BSc Cyber Security Student and am looking forward to build a strong foundation in this field. In order to pursue my role as a Penetration Tester and Digital Forensic Specialist, I am eager to start my career by actively researching security topics and working with computer languages, with Python being my area of expertise. Already diving deep into real-world skills by building personal cybersecurity lab and vulnerable machines, solving challenges on TryHackMe and OverTheWire, and learning tools like Wireshark, Nmap, Burpsuite, Metasploit, FTK Imager and Autopsy.
